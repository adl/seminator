  abstract = {We present the second generation of the tool Seminator
		  that transforms transition-based generalized B{\"u}chi
		  automata (TGBAs) into equivalent semi-deterministic
		  automata. The tool has been extended with numerous
		  optimizations and produces considerably smaller automata
		  than its first version. In connection with the
		  state-of-the-art LTL to TGBAs translator Spot, Seminator~2
		  produces smaller (on average) semi-deterministic automata
		  than the direct LTL to semi-deterministic automata
		  translator \texttt{ltl2ldgba} of the Owl library. Further,
		  Seminator~2 has been extended with an improved NCSB
		  complementation procedure for semi-deterministic automata,
		  providing a new way to complement automata that is
		  competitive with state-of-the-art complementation tools.},
