  abstract = {We present a tool that transforms nondeterministic
		  $\omega$-automata to semi-deterministic $\omega$-automata.
		  The tool Seminator accepts transition-based generalized
		  B\"uchi automata (TGBA) as an input and produces automata
		  with two kinds of semi-determinism. The implemented
		  procedure performs degeneralization and
		  semi-determinization simultaneously and employs several
		  other optimizations. We experimentally evaluate Seminator
		  in the context of LTL to semi-deterministic automata
		  translation.},
